									<h2>My Story</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to be a teacher, or so I thought. I enjoyed learning and teaching others what I knew.
								After a few years in a classroom teaching children, I felt stagnant. I wanted to keep learning new things, so I took an interest in 
								money management and taught myself the ins and outs of the finance world. I passed the dreaded FINRA certifications and 
								<span id="dots">...</span>
								<span id="more"> became a financial
								advisor. After a few years, I found myself wanting to be apart of a team again and collaborating with others. I took a job as a Children's Librarian,
								with my background in education . I quickly became the head of the department and moved to a larger library with a bigger staff. As part of my job, I 
								created programs for children/teens. I've always had an interest in tech and created a coding program at my library, using Google's CS First program as 
								a guide. After that, I continued to offer coding programs and fell in love with coding and all that it offered. I decided to take a leap of faith 
								and enroll myself in a 3 month intesive Full Stack Development Bootcamp. Based out of Spain and working remotely, I woke up every day at 2am to join my online
								cohort at 9am Barcelona time. I never missed a day or dreaded waking up those early mornings because I was excited and ready to learn something new. Something I 
								am looking foward to as I continue my journey into tech...I can keep learning new things every day!

									<h2>Break Into Tech</h2>
								</header>
								<p> I will admit, I did not know what I was getting myself into. I had taken free HTML/CSS courses online. I had even experimented with a little Python.
								I was very used to being good at everything I did. Well, let's just say that was not the case at first. I was lost and confused and thinking I had made 
								a big mistake. I remember hearing this at orientation, "Be brave enough to suck at
								<span id="dots2">...</span>
								<span id="more2"> something new." And that fueled me for the first couple of weeks. However, no matter how overwhelmed I felt at the end of each day. I was still excited
								and ready to take it all on again the next day. Those next weeks flew by and at the end of the bootcamp, I was left wanting more. I am so glad I made the jump
								and am ready to start my new role as a Software Engineer and keep learning new skills everyday.
